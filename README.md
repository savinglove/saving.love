This website will eventually support legacy browsers, like Internet Explorer 6. <br>
Newer versions of Internet Explorer and "IETester" won't emulate as intended... but using IE6 with Windows XP will completely succeed eventually. <br>
Internet Explorer 6 can't use https with default settings, you'll need http://saving.love/ instead. <br>
Legacy browsers aren't prioritized.
